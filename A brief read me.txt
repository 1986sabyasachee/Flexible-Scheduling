1) Individual folders contain the data for particular benchmark under different TAM Widths and different layers.

2) All necessary input files are given in the folder named as per benchmark name, like "d695" or "d695_Windows".

3) First, the user have to create an executable (here "scheduling.o") using the file "Schduling_efficient.c" to generate the scheduling output.

 The output gets stored in the file named as "out_<TAM-Width>_new.txt" and "out_<TAM-Width>_read.txt" for later use.

4) Then simply use the  "run2.c" or "run3.c" or "run4.c" to execute the assignments of cores in 2, 3 and 4 nmber of tiers respectively. Before that one must ensure that they have generated the executable (here "placement.o" or "placement.exe") from placement.c

5) In the folder named "<benchmark name>_Windows", the file  "excel_<area constraint>.txt" will be generated as a summary of result. Here each row represents the following columns respectively - "alpha" "layer", "TAM-Width", "Test-time" and  "Number of TSV".
